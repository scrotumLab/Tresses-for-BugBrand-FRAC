Tresses v1.1 in FRAC format for BugBrand Modular System

With the permission of Émilie Gillet (Mutable Instruments), Scrotum Lab made this version of Braids in FRAC format compatible with the BugBrand Modular System.

In this repository you will find:

    • The PCB file in Diptrace format.
    • The panel as PCB in Diptrace format.

The schematics and the firmware used for Tresses were the original files published by Mutable Instruments. Some components were changed directly on the circuit board itself.
